## Getting Started

### Running the Game Locally
To run the game on localhost, execute the following commands:
```
cd .\client\
npm i
npm start
```
## Technical Details for Deployment

### Setting Up
If you want to deploy the contract using hardhat, enter values for the following parameters in the `.env` file:
```
PRI_KEY = <your-private-key>
```

### Deploying Contracts
- in the root folder execute command npm i.

- Deploy the `gameFactory` contract with the command:
```
npx hardhat run --network xrpl .\scripts\deploy_factory.js
```
- Deploy the `NFTbadge` contract using the command:
```
npx hardhat run --network xrpl .\scripts\deploy_nft.js
```

- **Connect Your Wallet**: Before diving into the game, ensure you've connected your wallet. If the XRPL EVM Sidechain (1440002) is not configured in your MetaMask wallet, follow the steps below to set it up:

  ### Configuring the XRPL EVM Sidechain in MetaMask:
  1. Open the MetaMask extension.
  2. Use the drop-down menu to choose **Add Network**.
  3. Enter the XRP Ledger Devnet endpoint information:
     - **Network Name**: XRPL EVM Sidechain
     - **New RPC URL**: https://rpc-evm-sidechain.xrpl.org
     - **Chain ID**: 1440002
     - **Currency Symbol**: XRP
     - **Block Explorer**: https://evm-sidechain.xrpl.org

- **About the Game**: Familiarize yourself with the game's objectives and mechanics.
- **Preparation**: Make sure you're connected to the testnet and have received the necessary tokens from the faucet.

---

### Fallback Learning Lab:
- Copy the smart contract address code and paste it into a new file in the Remix IDE.
- In Remix IDE, click the `Deploy & RUN TRANSACTIONS` tab, then click the select box under the `ENVIRONMENT` heading and select the `Injected Provider: MetaMask` option. (Make sure the digital wallet is set to chain 1440002).
- Copy the smart contract address, which is under the heading `Your Test Address`, navigate to Remix IDE, and paste the contract address in the `At Address` input box. Next, click the `At Address` button to enable access to the deployed smart contract's user interface.
- Now click on the newly created tab under the heading `Deployed Contracts`, then click on the `Transact` button, which is under the heading `CALLDATA` and confirm the transaction. (To verify that the transaction was successfully completed, click the `FixMe` button in Remix IDE or on the game website and check that the value has changed to true.)
- Navigate to the game site and click the `Submit` button.

---

### Balance Learning Lab:
- Select a wallet address or contract address and copy it (don't select your wallet address as your wallet balance will change once you call the function).
- Enter the address you copied into the `_account` input box.
- Open the code editor you use and create an index.js file with the following code:
``` javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const https = 'https://rpc-evm-sidechain.xrpl.org';
const web3 = new Web3(https);

async function balance(){
const bal = await web3.eth.getBalance("<paste-address-here>")
console.log(bal);
  }
balance()

```
- Replace the <paste-address-here> with the address that you copied and run the script.
- Copy the balance from the terminal.
- Navigate to the game site and enter the balance you copied into the `_amount` input box.
- Press the `checkBalance` button and confirm the transaction.

---

### Wei Learning Lab:
- Copy the smart contract code address and paste it into a new file in the Remix IDE.
- In Remix IDE, click the `DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS` tab, then click the select box under the `ENVIRONMENT` heading and select the `Injected Provider: MetaMask` option. (Make sure the digital wallet is set to chain 1440002).
- Copy the smart contract address, which is under the heading `Your Test Address`, navigate to Remix IDE, and paste the contract address in the `At Address` input box. Next, click the `At Address` button to enable access to the deployed smart contract's user interface.
- Enter the number 1 in the input box under the heading `VALUE`, ensuring that the ETHEREUM UNIT is set to Wei.
- Now click on the newly created tab under the heading `Deployed Contracts`, then click on the `Transact` button under the heading `CALDATA` and confirm the transaction. (To verify that the transaction was successfully completed, note that the amount of ETH sent to the contract is equal to Balance: 0.000000000000000001 ETH.)
- Navigate to the game site and click the `Submit` button.

---

### Timestamp Learning Lab:
- Click the hint button and copy the hash that represents the newly deployed contract, and paste it into the search box on the website `https://evm-sidechain.xrpl.org/`.
- Copy the block number.
- Open the code editor you use and create an index.js file with the following code:
```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const https = 'https://rpc-evm-sidechain.xrpl.org';
const web3 = new Web3(https);
web3.eth.getBlock("<Block-Number>",console.log)
```
- Replace `<Block-Number>` with the block number you copied.
- Run the script and copy the timestamp from the received output.
- Navigate to the game site, enter the timestamp you copied into the `_Timestamp` input box, and press the `timeReset` button, then confirm the transaction.

---

### Gas Learning Lab:
1. **Base Gas Consumption (Overhead)**: When the function is called with the argument `0`, it uses up 42 units of gas. This represents the overhead of invoking the function without the loop's operations.
2. **Gas Consumption for a Single Iteration**: On invoking the function with an argument of `1`, it results in a gas consumption of 234 units.

Using the above data:
```
Gas Per Iteration = 234 - 42 = 192 units
```
To find the average gas consumption between 3000 and 5000:
```
Average Gas Consumption = (3000 + 5000) / 2 = 4000 units
```
Applying this to our function's gas consumption pattern:
```
42 + 192x = 4000
=> 192x = 3958
=> x â‰ˆ 20.61
```
Thus, it is deduced that about 21 iterations are requisite to approach an average gas consumption of 4000 units.
- Enter the number 21 in the `iterations` input box.
- Click the `complexOperation` button and confirm the transaction.
---

### Password Learning Lab:
- Copy the smart contract address, which is under the heading `Your Test Address`.
- Open the code editor you use and create an index.js file with the following code:
```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const https = 'https://rpc-evm-sidechain.xrpl.org';
const web3 = new Web3(https);
web3.eth.getStorageAt("<contract-address>",0,console.log)
```
- Replace `<contract-address>` with the smart contract address you copied.
- Run the script and copy the hexadecimal number from the received output.
- Enter the hexadecimal number in the input box `_password`.
- Enter any number in the `newPassword` input box.
- Click the `changePassword` button and confirm the transaction.

---

### Overflow Learning Lab:
(type(uint256).max) = Max

  (Max - 3)[------------------Max------0-------------------]3
           |                   |       |                   |
        counter     (counter + 3)     (counter + 4)     (counter + 7)   

When the `counter` starts at `Max - 3`, the overflow logic is:

1. When `3` uints are added to the counter, it reaches `Max`.
2. Adding to the starting value `4` causes an overflow, resetting the counter to `0`.
3. If `7` is added to the starting value, the counter wraps around and becomes `3`.

- Enter the number 7 in the `value` input box.
- Click the `add` button and confirm the transaction.

---

- Copy the hash that represents the block.
- Navigate to the game site and enter the hash you copied into the `blockHash` input box.
- Click the `blockHashCheck` button and confirm the transaction.
